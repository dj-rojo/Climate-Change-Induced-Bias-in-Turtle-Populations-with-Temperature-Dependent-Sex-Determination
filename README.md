# Welcome

This project showcases an agent-based model developed in NetLogo, along with the accompanying code for data analysis. It was submitted as part of my bachelor's thesis to achieve a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Systems Science at the University of Graz. The model simulates a sea turtle population with a basic reproductive cycle, demonstrating how climate change-induced feminization might affect it.
For more information and a detailed description of the methods see my thesis paper as published in this repository. 

# Background

Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in turtles is an adaptive strategy that increases the production of female hatchlings when eggs are exposed to warmer incubation temperatures. Under the influence of rapid anthropogenic climate change, this adaptation may become a threat, as turtle populations face high levels of feminization. This study uses an agent-based modeling approach to explore the threshold at which an increased percentage of female hatchlings leads to population instability, decline, or even extinction, assuming all other temperature-induced effects besides sex ratio biases are disregarded.

In the simulation, a fictional sea turtle population starting with a 50-50 sex ratio undergoes a simplified reproductive cycle, producing hatchlings at a predetermined primary sex ratio, varied across scenarios. Additionally, the number of females a single male turtle can mate with in one season is adjusted to test how the populationâ€™s sensitivity to sex ratio changes under different levels of pollution.

# Limitations

While the model uses input data grounded in scientific research, the simplified reproductive cycle has certain limitations. A model is always a simplified representation of a natural system and should be interpreted as such. The limitations of this model include the exclusion of female breeding intervals, the smaller population sizes compared to natural turtle populations, and the disregard for genetic effects and other temperature-induced impacts on turtle hatchlings. 

Despite these limitations, modeling remains a valuable tool for informing conservation efforts and exploring ecological questions.
